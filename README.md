## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![p-value](https://github.com/jolwig/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCar_linear_regression/p-value.png)
* Vehichle_length and ground_clearance are least likley to provide a non-random vairance to mpg
* The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is smaller than the significance level of 0.05 which means the slope of the linear model is not 0.
* R-squared is 0.715 which means that 71.5% of future data will be able to fit the model, therefore the linear model will predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The total variance for all of the lots is 62.29, which meets the criteria. Both lots 1 and 2 had a variance well bellow 100 but lot 3 had a variance of 170.29 which is above the maximum limit.
