## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![p-value](https://github.com/jolwig/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCar_linear_regression/p-value.png)
* Vehichle_length and ground_clearance are least likley to provide a non-random vairance to mpg
* The p-value is 5.35e-11 which is smaller than the significance level of 0.05 which means the slope of the linear model is not 0.
* R-squared is 0.715 which means that 71.5% of future data will be able to fit the model, therefore the linear model will predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
